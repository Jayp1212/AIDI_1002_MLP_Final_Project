# AIDI_1002_MLP_Final_Project
***
Welcome to the final project repository for the Machine Learning Programming course AIDI 1002. Our team consists of Jay Patel and Dhartiben Patel.
***
## Objective:
***
Our project aims to explore and compare the effectiveness of different neural network models in forecasting financial time series data. We focus on models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). By identifying the most accurate and efficient model, we aim to enhance decision-making processes in the financial sector.
***
## Problem Description:
***
Our project focuses on predicting future financial data based on historical time series data using neural networks. This task holds significant importance for decision-making in finance. By leveraging neural networks, we aim to uncover intricate patterns and relationships in the data to make accurate predictions about future financial trends.
***
## Limitations of Other Approaches:
***
Traditional methods of financial forecasting, including statistical and econometric models, often rely on assumptions that may not hold true in real-world scenarios. Machine learning approaches, while powerful, can be limited by the need for large datasets and the potential for overfitting. Neural networks offer a solution by modeling complex, non-linear relationships in data, but they require careful tuning and validation.
***
## Our Contribution:
***
We introduced the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to the project, enhancing its capabilities beyond the original research paper. Through a comparative analysis, we demonstrated the competitive performance of the GRU model in financial time series forecasting. We validated the robustness of the GRU model and contributed to a deeper understanding of neural network applications in financial forecasting.
***
## Future Work:
***
Our project opens avenues for further enhancements to the GRU model, including exploring different architectural variations and fine-tuning hyperparameters. We are committed to advancing the field of financial forecasting through continuous research and innovation.
